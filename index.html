                <p>Stress can be defined as any type of change that
                     causes physical, emotional, or mental strain. 
                     Stress is your body's response to anything that requires attention or action.
                     Everyone experiences stress 
                     to some degree. The way you respond to stress, however, makes a 
                     big difference to your overall mental and 
                     physical well-being.
